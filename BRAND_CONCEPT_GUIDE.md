# 13 DEGREES LOUNGE BAR: Brand & Concept Intelligence

This document serves as the master blueprint for the **13 Degrees** digital presence and menu architecture. Use this as a strict guideline for any future development (Full Website, Mobile App, or Marketing Materials).

## 1. The Core Concept: "Smart Luxury"
*   **Philosophy**: Delivering Michelin-level gastronomic prestige with high-precision technology and minimal operational complexity.
*   **The Hook**: "Raw, Rare & Crispy" — focus on the world's most premium Bluefin Tuna (*Atún Rojo de Almadraba*).
*   **Target Audience**: 
    *   *Guests*: High-end lifestyle seekers in Estepona/Andalusia.
    *   *Owners*: Business-driven entrepreneurs looking for high margins and operational efficiency.

## 2. Visual Identity & Design System
*   **Aesthetic**: "Noir Premium" — Dark, immersive, and high-contrast.
*   **Color Palette**:
    *   `--bg-dark`: `#0a0a0a` (Deep Void)
    *   `--accent-gold`: `#d4af37` (Luxury Accent)
    *   `--bg-card`: `#151515` (Charcoal UI)
    *   `--border-gold`: `rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.4)`
*   **Typography**:
    *   *Headings*: `Playfair Display` (Serif, Elegant, Timeless).
    *   *Body*: `Inter` (Sans-serif, Modern, High-readability).

## 3. UX/UI Mechanics (The "Wow" Factor)
*   **Atmosphere Parallax**: Use deep vertical parallax on lifestyle sections to create depth.
*   **Ambient Glow**: Subtle mouse-tracking radial gradients (`radial-gradient` of gold at 10% opacity) to simulate lounge lighting.
*   **Smooth Motion**: All content should use `IntersectionObserver` for fade-in/slide-up reveals.
*   **The "Ficha Técnica" Interaction**:
    *   Main dish image shrinks to a header (30% height).
    *   Technical data slides up from the bottom on a dark charcoal background.

## 4. Operational "Smart Ops" Logic
Every menu item must follow these constraints:
*   **No full kitchen needed**: Focus on specialized equipment (Industrial Torch, Electric Slicer, Deep Fryer, Vacuum Sealer).
*   **Technical Map (SOP)**: Every dish must have a "How-to" guide in the backend/modal for staff training.
*   **Economic Transparency**: Display Food Cost (Materia Prima) vs. PVP vs. Profit Margin to demonstrate business value.

## 5. Tone of Voice
*   **Sophisticated**: Using technical terms (Aburi, Lomo, Arbequina).
*   **Business-Oriented**: Focus on "ROI," "YIELD," and "EFFICIENCY."
*   **Bilingual**: Mix of Russian for management and Spanish/English for the guest experience.

## 6. Technical Requirements
*   **Mobile-First**: Must be flawless on iPhone SE thru iPhone 15 Pro Max and high-end Androids.
*   **Performant**: 100/100 Lighthouse score (Zero bloat).
*   **No Placeholders**: Use real lifestyle photos from the bar's social media (Pinterest/Facebook) and high-quality AI dish renders.
